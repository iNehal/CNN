# Dog Cat Image Classification

## Problem Statement

In this Section we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training is 25,000 and final testing is done on seperate 5,000 images.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled images for both dogs and cats. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

## Model Training

The CNN model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
